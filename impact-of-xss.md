# impact of xss
    Data Theft: XSS attacks can steal sensitive user data such as login credentials, session cookies, and personal information by sending this data to the attacker's server.

    Account Hijacking: Attackers can use stolen session cookies or login credentials to take control of a user's account, gaining access to their personal information and potentially making unauthorized transactions or changes.

    Phishing: XSS can be used to create convincing phishing pages that trick users into entering their sensitive information, which is then captured by the attacker.

    Defacement: Attackers can deface a website by injecting malicious scripts that alter the appearance or content of web pages. This can damage a website's reputation and trustworthiness.

    Malware Distribution: Malicious scripts injected via XSS can also serve as a delivery mechanism for malware, infecting users' devices when they visit the compromised website.

    Session Hijacking: XSS can allow attackers to steal active session cookies, giving them unauthorized access to a user's session and potentially causing damage or performing actions on behalf of the victim.

    Data Manipulation: Attackers can use XSS to modify data on a website, which can have far-reaching consequences depending on the website's purpose. For example, in an e-commerce site, an attacker could change product prices or quantities.

    SEO Manipulation: If an attacker injects malicious content into a website's pages, it can affect search engine rankings, leading to a loss of reputation and visibility.

    Reputation Damage: A successful XSS attack can damage the reputation of the affected website, causing users to lose trust and confidence in its security.

    Legal and Compliance Issues: Data breaches and security incidents resulting from XSS attacks can lead to legal and regulatory repercussions, including fines and legal actions.

    Loss of User Trust: Users may lose trust in a website or online service that has been compromised by an XSS attack, leading to a loss of customers and revenue.
